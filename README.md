# Euro 2024 Final Field Players Line ups.

This project shows the final lineup for the Euro 2024 football tournament using machine learning techniques.


The Euro 2024 Final Field Players Lineup is a Python project that aims to portray the final lineup of teams for the Euro 2024 football tournament. The project leverages historical data, that is there official used names and machine learning models to generate the line up as it was during the famous final.

 Features

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Positioning and player evaluation
- Coding,implementation and testing
- Final lineup exhibition 
- Visualization of results

   Ensure you have the dataset in the correct format.The eye catching final lineup will be saved in the pitch22.py file. The project uses turtle position for the smooth position of players identity. It also showcases the entire football pitch and there very markings.
The dataset used for this project includes historical match data, and other relevant information.

The project uses various machine learning models to illustrate the final lineup. You can find the model training scripts and evaluation metrics in the pitch22.py directory.
The results of the predictions are shown upon run up of the project.
